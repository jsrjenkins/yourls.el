#+Title: yourls.el --- URL Shortener with Yourls

This library implements convenient functions to shorten an url with [[http://yourls.org/#API][Yourls API]], [[http://yourls.org/][Your Own URL Shortener]].

It provides two commands to shorten, `yourls-at-point' and `yourls-region'. It also contains a command to expand the shortened url at point `yourls-get-point'. You can also make a custom url with the function `yourls-make-custom'.

To used it you have to define two variables, `yourls-api-endpoint' and
`yourls-api-signature'.  Your can learn them at http://yourls.org/#API.

This is heavily modified from the original extension by Yasushi SHOJI, which is no longer working and apparently no longer maitained. For this reason we publish here this entirely new version.
